# CS331 Neural Computing

## Running the code
In order to run the code used for this experiment, `nnet.py` should be executed. A list of packages is found at the start of the file before it may be executed. The script is written in Python 3.6.7, and can be run from the command line using 

```> python nnet.py```

It is not necessary to access, modify or run `generatedata.py`. Depending on the setup, there may be warning messages when running the script, but it will be operating properly.
